<a href ="http://www.makersquare.com">MakerSquare</a> is a coding school smack in the middle of downtown Austin. Their primary offering is an immersive 10-week coding bootcamp where they promise to turn you from a coding newb into a marketable software developer. They now also offer part-time classes including a front-end course and a back-end course. 
 
I'm currently enrolled in the front-end course, attending classes every Monday and Wednesday evening from 6:30 to 9:30 for 10 weeks. We're covering HTML5, CSS3, javaScript, and jQuery. I have to say the classes are a lot of fun.
