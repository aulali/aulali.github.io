  Super-rad apprenticeship and workshop opportunities for girls.

<p>
 A couple years ago, I attended an event called <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a> at <a href="http://capitalfactory.com">Capital Factory</a> in Austin. Rails Girls is a free two-day workshop where girls and women can jump into learning Ruby on Rails. It was an awesome event and when the coaches introduced themselves, I learned about two awesome women, Cheyenne Weaver and Diana Griffin who were working on an awesome idea of their called <a href="https://www.girlsguild.com">The Girls Guild</a>.  The Girls Guild, according to the website, is "a service that offers apprenticeships for girls, by girls." Check out the GirlsGuild website and there is always a variety of amazing learning opportunities, allowing women to work with makers such as cholatiers, professional photographers, and jewellry designers.

Earlier this year, I signed up to be a Ruby on Rails developer with Diana and Cheyenne, and it's been an amazing learning opportunity.
